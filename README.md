This repository contains the API contract between a Coder workspace agent and
[boundary](https://github.com/coder/boundary). This repository intends to serve
as the source of truth for the API and should be imported by both coder/coder
and boundary.

To generate the Go code, run `make` from within the coder/coder nix environment.
